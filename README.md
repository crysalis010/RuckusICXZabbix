# Ruckus ICX Zabbix Template

This is a basic template for Zabbix 6.0+ to discover and monitor ICX switches. This template was created with Ruckus MIB file specified for switch code (not Router code) and using Firmware 08095G. 

Template should discover interfaces, their status and speeds. It should also detect fans, power supplies and stacking information. Basic triggers have been included for power supply failure. 

This is a work in progress!
